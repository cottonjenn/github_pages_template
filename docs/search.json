    "text": "In data science, combining data from multiple tables is common, but choosing the wrong SQL join can lead to incomplete or misleading results. This tutorial helps students understand how INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER joins affect outcomes when merging tables (e.g., customers and orders), and guides on selecting the right join for analysis tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with two basic tables to illustrate joins. Imagine we have a customers table (with customer details) and an orders table (with purchase records). We’ll use a primary key (customer_id) in customers that acts as a foreign key in orders. For this static tutorial, we’ll define the tables directly as Markdown tables below. In a real SQL environment (like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL), you would create these tables using CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements.\nCustomers Table: | customer_id | name | email | |————-|———-|——————-| | 1 | Alice | alice@email.com | | 2 | Bob | bob@email.com | | 3 | Charlie | charlie@email.com | | 4 | Dana | dana@email.com | | 5 | Eve | eve@email.com |\nOrders Table:\n\n\n\norder_id\ncustomer_id\nproduct\namount\n\n\n\n\n101\n1\nLaptop\n1200.0\n\n\n102\n2\nPhone\n800.0\n\n\n103\n1\nTablet\n300.0\n\n\n104\n6\nMonitor\n200.0\n\n\n105\n3\nKeyboard\n50.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn INNER JOIN returns only rows where there’s a match in both tables based on the join condition (e.g., customer_id).\nSELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.product, o.amount\nFROM customers c\nINNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;\nExpected Result: | | customer_id | name | order_id | product | amount | |—|————-|———|———-|———-|——–| | 0 | 1 | Alice | 101 | Laptop | 1200.0 | | 1 | 1 | Alice | 103 | Tablet | 300.0 | | 2 | 2 | Bob | 102 | Phone | 800.0 | | 3 | 3 | Charlie | 105 | Keyboard | 50.0 |\nNotice: Only matched customers (1,2,3) appear; Dana (4), Eve (5), and the unmatched order (104 for customer 6) are excluded.\n\n\n\nA LEFT JOIN keeps all rows from the left table (customers), with matching rows from the right (orders). Unmatched right-side columns get NULL.\nSELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.product, o.amount\nFROM customers c\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;\n\n\n\n\ncustomer_id\nname\norder_id\nproduct\namount\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nAlice\n101\nLaptop\n1200.0\n\n\n1\n1\nAlice\n103\nTablet\n300.0\n\n\n2\n2\nBob\n102\nPhone\n800.0\n\n\n3\n3\nCharlie\n105\nKeyboard\n50.0\n\n\n4\n4\nDana\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\n\n5\n5\nEve\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\n\n\nHere, all customers are included, with NULLS for Dana and Eve’s orders. Unmatched orders (like 104) are dropped.\n\n\n\nA FULL OUTER JOIN (or just OUTER JOIN in some dialects) includes all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there’s no match. (Note: In SQLite, this is FULL OUTER JOIN; in MySQL, it’s emulated with UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins.)\nSELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.product, o.amount\nFROM customers c\nFULL OUTER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;\n\n\n\n\ncustomer_id\nname\norder_id\nproduct\namount\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nAlice\n101\nLaptop\n1200.0\n\n\n1\n1\nAlice\n103\nTablet\n300.0\n\n\n2\n2\nBob\n102\nPhone\n800.0\n\n\n3\n3\nCharlie\n105\nKeyboard\n50.0\n\n\n4\n4\nDana\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\n\n5\n5\nEve\nNone\nNone\nNone\n\n\n6\n6\nNone\n104\nMonitor\n200.0\n\n\n\nThis shows everything: matched rows, plus unmatched customers (4,5) and the unmatched order (104).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Type\nRows Returned\nIncludes Unmatched Left?\nIncludes Unmatched Right?\nUse Case Example\n\n\n\n\nINNER JOIN\n4\nNo\nNo\nGet only customers with orders\n\n\nLEFT JOIN\n6\nYes (with NULLs)\nNo\nAnalyze all customers, including those without orders\n\n\nFULL OUTER JOIN\n7\nYes (with NULLs)\nYes (with NULLs)\nAudit all data, spotting orphans in either table"
